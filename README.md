# Visited_Countries
Updated version of my old project which consisted basically of an HTML that used an SVG map to show which countries you had visited. I've added database support with an Sqlite3 to simplify things and two inputs to add/remove. Now there is no need to edit the source code, it can be done just by typing in the names of the countries (both inputs have JQuery's autocomplete).

There could be infinitely possible improvements (especially concerning the UI) to the project, so I invite you to fork the repository!
